# Transparent Network Logging For ArgentX

Starknet Paris hackathon submission

Crypto services are flashier and more user-friendly than ever, but few understand what goes on under the hood.

We want to provider a transparent logger add-on to Argent X wallet, so that users can see directly all the network requests initiated by the Argent X wallet, making Argent X a transparent and trustworthy wallet for all the crypto users.

During the hackathon, we have worked on showcasing all the https requests sent from Argent X wallet in the background process.

In the future we would like to extend the coverage of requests to all the JSON RPC requests that go through the blockchain interfaces.
