## 🧒 Example dapp

You can try the extension using our example dapp hosted at:

[https://argentlabs.github.io/argent-x/](https://argentlabs.github.io/argent-x/)

The example dapp is also contained in this repository.

## 🌐 Usage with your dapp

If you want to use this StarkNet Wallet extension with your dapp, the easiest way is to checkout the `@argent/get-starknet` package developed in this repo by running:

```bash
# starknet.js is a peer dependency
yarn add @argent/get-starknet starknet
```

The package is a light wrapper around [starknet.js](https://github.com/seanjameshan/starknet.js) to interact with the wallet extension. You can then use it like the following:

```javascript
import { getStarknet } from "@argent/get-starknet"

// Check if wallet extension is installed and initialized.
const starknet = getStarknet()
// May throw when no extension is detected, otherwise shows a modal prompting the user to download Argent X.
const [userWalletContractAddress] = await starknet.enable({ showModal: true })

// Check if connection was successful
if(starknet.isConnected) {
    // If the extension was installed and successfully connected, you have access to a starknet.js Signer object to do all kinds of requests through the user's wallet contract.
    starknet.signer.invokeFunction({ ... })
} else {
    // In case the extension wasn't successfully connected you still have access to a starknet.js Provider to read starknet states and sent anonymous transactions
    starknet.provider.callContract( ... )
}
```

Checkout [starknet.js](https://github.com/seanjameshan/starknet.js) to learn more about how to use `Provider` and `Signer`.

## 🚀 Install from sources
